  <h2> Who am I? </h2>
  <p>
    Heyyy, I'm Iris!! I'm 16 years old and have been at ISW Hoogeland for 5 years now. 
    Last year I took exams at the mavo level and thought I could also manage a havo diploma. 
    In my free time, I do quite a lot of things, but to read about that you have to go to the <a href="hobbys.html"> hobby's</a> page. 
    I also really enjoy listening to music, it's one of the things that gives me comfort. 
    My favorite color is a kind of dark blue, it's a really beautiful color. 
    I used to also do the sport of bouldering and did that for 2 years, but unfortunately, due to problems with my shoulder, I had to stop. 
    I also have a sister whom I am very close to, her name is Melissa and she is 22 years old.

    I have a cat named Bollie, he is almost 10 years old (he's a bit chubby). 
    He doesn't really like cuddling and so on, but other than that he is nice to almost everyone. I've had him since 2016.
  </p>

    I also have quite a lot of friends, but my closest friend is Ruben. I met him at school when we were both in the first year.  
Back then we were still in mavo/havo. Our core memory is that when we first met, I hit him with a stick and a week later there was still a mark (don't ask how ahahah).  
We also have quite a lot of inside jokes.  
We didn't really talk that much back then, but since last year we've become very close and I'm really happy to have him. In my eyes, he's like a brother.  
Through him, I also indirectly (through his little brother) met my partner, and I’ve been with her for a few months now, which I’m very grateful for.  
By now, we've known each other for a little over 5 years, and he's now at a different school. 
It's strange not seeing him every day anymore, I really do miss that.
